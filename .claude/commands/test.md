# Run Tests

Run all tests with verbose output following the project's TDD/ATDD methodology.

```bash
cargo test --verbose
```

If tests fail, analyze the output and fix issues following the TDD cycle:
1. Identify the failing test
2. Understand what the test expects
3. Make minimal changes to pass
4. Refactor if needed
